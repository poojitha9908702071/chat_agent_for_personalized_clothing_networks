This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Run in Chrome by default (Windows)

If you want the dev server to automatically open in Google Chrome on Windows, use the included script:

```bash
npm run dev:chrome
```

This uses `concurrently` and `wait-on` to start the Next.js dev server and open Chrome when the server is ready. If you don't have those packages installed yet, run `npm install` first.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
